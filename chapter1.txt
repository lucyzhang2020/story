Chapter 1

There was once a group of kids. Their names were Remedy, Luca, Victoria, Cody, and Skye. They always had fun together exploring new places and discovering treasures. They were in the middle of the jungle when they were approached by 5 teenagers. They said that "the sky was falling and they should get underground to stay safe". Luca looked up and saw that it was actually falling. “We need to get 
underground”. said Cody. “But how do we get underground?” Asked Remedy. “We could go through my father's mine shaft to go to the center of the earth.” Said Luca. “No, I don't want to go underground. It makes you all dirty.” Said Victoria. “We could go through the mini castle.”

In the village of Regtaco, you would have to give your names to the guards that surround the borders of the huge village. The king and queen of the village is Rex and Staccy renegade.  They had a daughter and a son. The son was Cody and daughter Victoria. They all decided to go through the palace to the mini castle that leads to the center of the earth. There was a diamond minecart that went straight and down. It was safe because a spell was placed on it so nothing could get through the force field other than those who had permission by the king and queen. They decided that they would walk over the hills and go through a secret passage that leads to the castle's rear entrance. The people of the village didn't know about this entrance but the royals knew and they got caught.
