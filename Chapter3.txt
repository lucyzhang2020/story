Chapter 3	

They headed over to the caves to find more plasma guns. It was creepy and they tried to get past lots of vines. They suddenly found a chest with 30 more plasma guns. There was every single color except for black and blue. They were about to head back when 4 zombies came up to them and attacked them. They used their plasma guns to eliminate them and decided that they could either head back and get more people to come or they could continue on alone. They decided that it was a good idea to head back so they could be more safe and still happily find more plasma rifles. They were about to exit the cave when the 5 teenagers that had approached them walked up to them and said that they wanted the plasma rifles and also their rifles. They said that they were about to go and find more plasma rifles when they were told through a loudspeaker that said "All people report to the meeting room."
